<h2 id="what-is-it" align="center">What is it?</h2>

This is my first not ready yet project which I decided to share. This bot is written with [vkbottle asynchronous VK API framework](https://github.com/vkbottle/vkbottle) and planned as a convenient tool for schedule tracking which polytechnic students will be able to use without leaving the VK messenger.

<h2 id="features" align="center">Features</h2>

PolySchedule is developing, firstly, to be convenient and comfortable for the user, as well as understandable in use.
- The main feature is that it sends the schedule with an image, not text
- PolySchedule can send a schedule both in one day and immediately in a week, in addition, the user can get a schedule for any date
